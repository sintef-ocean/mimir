* NAME

  =mimir= -- an optimization-based purse seine path planner

* SYNOPSIS

  ~/opt/sintef/bin/mimir [OPTIONS] CONFIG~

* DESCRIPTION

  A purse seine path planner algorithm that calculates suggested deployment paths based on
  user preferences and environmental conditions.

* OPTIONS

  The command is valid with install prefix set to /~/opt/sintef~/. If =$PATH= has
  =/opt/sintef/bin=, the executable name is simply =mimir=.

  + =CONFIG= :: Path to YAML config file.
  + =-h, --help= :: Display the help message.
  + =-v number, --severity number= :: Print severity, with /number/ as defined in /Severity/ below, default: 3.
  + =-l number, --log number= :: Log file severity: with /number/ as defined in /Severity/ below, default: 3.

  /Severity/ is an integer /number/ in [0-5], 5: trace, 4: debug, 3: info, 2: warning, 1: error, 0: fatal

* CONFIGURATION

  The YAML configuration file follows a specific schema, with two common map attributes:
  /dds/ and /algorithm/. The /algorithm:name/ defines the name of the algorithm to be run
  and imples that a map with the same name is present in the YAML file. The configuration
  specification for a selected algorithm is specific to that particular algorithm. See [[EXAMPLE]] below.

* ENVIRONMENT

  - =OSPL_URI= :: If =$OSPL_URI= is not set, it defaults to  /~file:///opt/sintef/etc/config/ospl.xml~/. This is the configuration file for the OpenSplice middleware service used by the application. See *OpenSplice deployment* for details on configuring the middleware service.
  - =OSPL_HOME= :: If =$OSPL_HOME= is not set, it defaults to /~/opt/sintef/~/. This is the root path used by the OpenSplice middleware.

* FILES

  - /~/opt/sintef/etc/config/ospl.xml/~/ :: OpenSplice configuration file as described in *OpenSplice deployment*.

* EXAMPLE

  - ~/opt/sintef/bin/mimir -v 0 -l 3 /path/to/config.yml~ :: Run algorithm specified in
    /~/path/to/config.yml/~/ with fatal severity output to terminal, and info severity
    output to log file. The YAML config file below shows the common schema that =mimir=
    expects. Note that the algoritm enters a standby state and will not execute before a
    =START_PROCESS= command is issued to the =request_topic= specified in the config file.

*** YAML config file

    The =algorithm:command= and =algorithm:notifier= entries are used to configure the DDS
    topics for user commands and state machine transition notifications. They use the
    interface definition language types indicated in the comment, which are defined in the
    =RatatoskIDL= dependency. Each algorithm has its own /algorithm-specific/ schema;
    consult the documentation for the algorithm you intend to use.

          reply_topic: fkin_cmd_resp             # IDL type: fkin::CommandResponse
          recipient: PursePlanner                # Recipient identifier request/reply
        notifier:
          notify_topic: fkin_state_notification  # IDL type: fkin::ProcessStateKind
          identifier: PursePlanner               # Identifier of notification

      PursePlanner:
        *algorithm-specific
      ...
    #+end_src

* NOTES

  Currently, the log outputs are only printed to stdout. This means that the *=-l | --log=* option
  has no effect.
