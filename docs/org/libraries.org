* A note on library dependencies

  The nonlinear programming (NLP) formulations in /mimir/ uses Casadi's =nlpsol=
  interface. Casadi implements interfaces to various third-party solvers, but several of
  them require a commercial license to use. Casadi also provides textbook or experimental
  solvers to solve such problems, but it is generally recommended to use a third-party
  solver for best performance and reliability, see cite:Andersson2019casadi for general
  recommendations. Solvers usually depend on low level routines such as LAPACK/BLAS or
  METIS. In cref:tab:MimirDependencies we provide an overview of various libraries with
  their license and availability on Linux and Windows. There are alternatives to these
  libraries, but these are the options /mimir/ can support without extra effort.

  The choice of solver can have large impact on solve time of an optimization problem,
  especially for large problems and by exploiting knowledge of problem structure. There
  are also other factors that can improve the solution times, including solver settings,
  using OpenMP, multi-threading, c-code generation, and discretization approach. We have
  not exhausted the performance improvement potential in our implementation efforts, so
  there is very likely performance gains available.
